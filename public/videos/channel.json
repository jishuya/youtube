ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

        "description": "roblox is DISGUSTING... (Schlep Roblox Lawsuit Drama EXPLAINED)\n\nSo recently Roblox Drama YouTuber Schlep known for his Pred Catching series on Roblox 'To Catch a Robloxian', where he collaborates with Ruben Sim, Jidion and more, was BANNED off of Roblox and THREATENED with a Lawsuit after Schlep received a CEASE AND DESIST from the Roblox Corporation. The Roblox Schlep Lawsuit / Ban Drama has gone VIRAL with many Large YouTuber's covering the Schlep Roblox Moderation Situation such as Charlie / MoistCritical, KreekCraft, Ruben Sim, Jidion and others. Roblox is now THREATENING to BAN other Roblox YouTubers including myself with their new HORRIBLE roblox moderation policies which Schlep had called them out for before. Since my last video Roblox RESPONDED by doubling down on their original claims and still refuse to UNBAN SCHLEP or FREE SCHLEP.\n\nSince everything I spoke about from my last video Schlep has teamed up with Chris Hansen, and surprisingly Roblox is being sued by the general attorney of Louisiana.\n\nMake sure to Leave a LIKE and SUBSCRIBE to help as many people as possible be made aware and informed/educated on this situation!
